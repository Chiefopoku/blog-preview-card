## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


I further polished my knowledge in css by importing font successfully 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
    position: absolute;
    margin: -8px;
    background-color: white;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 336px; 
    height: 480px; 
    padding: 24px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to improving my knowledge in custom css and improving readability of my code

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with positioning of divs and other css customizations. I really liked the information and study guide provided by this site and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css) - This is an amazing website with tons of resources and practice guides which helped me finally understand html tags. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
